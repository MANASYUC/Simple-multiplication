This Project "Simple Multiplication" was a test for exploring branching in git. In the project I was able to make multiple dev branches to keep updating my main branch. I also explored how to use .json file and .env file to make part of my code only work with the correct password. 

If you want to use this project for your own exploration you will need to modify from where to find your .env file and obviously enter your own password into the .json file to get access to the addition features of this project.
